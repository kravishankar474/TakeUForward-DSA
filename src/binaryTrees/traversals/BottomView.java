/*
 * Approach
1. Initialize a vector named ans to hold the final result of the top view traversal. 
	Also, set up a map to store nodes based on their vertical positions, 
	using the vertical index as the key and the node's value as the associated data.
2. Set up a queue to facilitate breadth-first search (BFS) traversal, starting with the root node, which is assigned a vertical position of 0.
3. Perform the following steps while the queue is not empty:
		1. Dequeue the node at the front of the queue and retrieve its vertical position. put in the map, 
			add the nodeâ€™s value to the map. This signifies that the node is the first one encountered at this vertical position 
			and should be included in the top view.
		2. If the vertical position is already in the map, skip adding this node, as a node positioned higher in the tree at 
			this vertical coordinate has already been processed and thus represents the top view for that vertical line.
		3. Enqueue the left child of the current node with a vertical position decremented by 1 (current position - 1) and 
			the right child with a vertical position incremented by 1 (current position + 1).
4. After completing the BFS traversal, iterate through the map to gather nodes in ascending order of their vertical positions. 
	Append these nodes to the ans vector. Finally, return the ans vector, which represents the top view traversal of the binary tree.

/*
 * Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N*logN), where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.
	This complexity arises because the algorithm performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of the tree, 
	visiting each node exactly once. And during the traversal, various map operations are performed which take logK complexity where K can be 
	N in the worst case. Thus, the overall time complexity comes out to be O(N*logN).

Space Complexity: O(N) : The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. 
	This space is primarily consumed by the queue used for BFS traversal, which can hold up to N/2 nodes in the worst case scenario of a balanced tree. Additionally, a map is used to store nodes based on their vertical positions, potentially also using up to N/2 entries in the worst case. Therefore, the overall space usage is proportional to the maximum width of the tree at any level.
